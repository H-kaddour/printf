### List of thing you gonna pick up during this project:
:wave:First you need to learn about `Variadic variales` the structure of them and how they work behind the scene this are some links to learn about them:
First manual it in the terminal `man stdarg`.

**Things i learned in Makefile in this project**
Add color for every excution:
```
YELLOW=$'\x1b[33m
BLUE=$'\x1b[34m
CYAN=$'\x1b[36m
```
You can add any color.
I print it cuz i made the command work silently, `@` work siently.
![image](image/colors.png)
```
@echo "$(CYAN) compile $(YELLOW) $^ $(BLUE)to $@"
```

# My final point:

I didn't have time to work in the bonus.

**Thank you for reading, have a good one :rocket:.**
